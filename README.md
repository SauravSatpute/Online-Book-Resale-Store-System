# Online-Book-Resale-Store
This is web app used for selling the secondhand book



This web app not only recommends books but also sentimental analyzes the reviews of buyers. It will use cosine similarity (content based filtering) for recommendation of books and LSTM (Long short term memory) algorithm for sentiment analysis of reviews. In addition to this, to make a secure system it also uses a log-based salt due to which it changes the hash of the user’s account’s password every time the user logins to the system.
